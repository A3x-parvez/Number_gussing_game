# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

A simple number guessing game written in Python. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.

## How to Play ðŸŽ®

1. When you run the program, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 100.
2. You will be prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the program will give you a hint:
   - **"Higher number Please."** if your guess is too low.
   - **"Lower number please."** if your guess is too high.
4. The game will end when you guess the correct number, and it will display the number of attempts you took.
